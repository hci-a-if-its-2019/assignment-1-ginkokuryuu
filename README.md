# Contextual Inquiry and Analysis
## Blender 3D Description
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the  entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation,  rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game  creation. Advanced users employ Blenderâ€™s API for Python scripting to  customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are  included in Blenderâ€™s future releases. Blender is well suited to  individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and  responsive development process.

## Instruction Script
1. Resize the box object in the new project
2. Rotate the box
3. Move the box
4. Add sphere object to the project
5. Save the blender file
6. Export the file to 3d object with format .FBX

## User Description
- She is a female
- She is 22 years old
- Public Health college student at  Airlangga University
- Never done a 3d modelling
- Never use blender 3d
- Sometime uses graphic design application

31. ðŸ˜ˆ 	: Mantap mantap, suwuuuunnnn

## Do's and Don't's
#### Do's

- Make the button of some function that is often used by user to be more visible, like Add, Move, Rotate, Scale, etc
- Make the button of some function that is seldom used by user to be more difficult to reach, so the user who is a novice won't accidentally clicked it
- Add some sort of tips as a pop up window when the user start the program, so user can easily remember how to do something and how not to do something
- Create a button to open a window that has the keyboard's shortcuts

#### Don't's

- Don't hide the button that often used by user in the toolbar's dropdown menu
- Don't make a function that can only be called using keyboard shortcuts

# Remarks
> * Thanks for completing all the parts in this assignment.
> * Just a little comments: Since you use time-codes to annotate the breakdowns in the `Models`, it is better to use time-codes as well in the `Transcript` instead of line-numbers. Thus, readers can track back easily the evidences of the breakdowns.
